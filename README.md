# ProxyScrape plugins pack

This repository contains plugins to ProxyScrape API (https://proxyscrape.com/).

## Plugins

### Free ProxyScrape (imus663.freeproxyscrape)

This plugin uses the free ProxyScrape API to fetch proxy lists without requiring authentication.

### Premium ProxyScrape (imus663.premproxyscrape)

This plugin is designed to work with the premium ProxyScrape API.

> The premium version implementation assumes the API returns the same data structure as the free version. Due to
> lack of complete documentation and test data for the premium API, correctness cannot be fully guaranteed. The plugin is
> built with the expectation that both versions share compatible response formats.
